 Two Registry Hacks 0.92
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 (c) 2006 Skylark

1. FOREWORD

I know that many people had problems with the font hack,  and also that the WAB
button changer  sucks big time by killing  all your settings.   So I ported the
parsedreg3 and fixupdreg3 tools to the PSP and prepared two easy-to-use hacks.

2. INSTALLATION

To install them for eLoader,  just copy all files from this  ZIP archive to the
Memory Stick.  You should have a "PSP/GAME" folder there from eLoader and a new
"FONTMOD" folder with a replacement font for the FontHack.

3.1. FONTHACK

The first tool,  FontHack, causes your PSP to load fonts from the Memory Stick.
Before running it, double-check that you have a "FONTMOD" folder on your stick!
Otherwise,  your PSP will reset to the default setting on the next reboot.  You
can use the excellent Book Antiqua provided in this package :D Running the hack
again will disable it. In other words, it's a switch.

3.2. BUTTONHACK

The second tool, ButtonHack,  swaps the functionality of [X] and [O] buttons in
XMB;  therefore,  it does pretty much what the WAB Button Changer can do. It is
however better,  since no settings should be lost (if everything goes right, of
course; if not, then I'm terribly sorry :( ).

4. LICENSE

The tools are licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.
To read the license, see "COPYING". Sources are in "source.tar.gz".

5. CONTACT

If something works differently than expected  and you followed this manual (!),
please send me an e-mail at skylark@ircwire.net.

I have put a lot of effort into ensuring  that the tool will rather stop in its
tracks and complain,  than write an inconsistent registry.  Should that happen,
all you will get is a bluescreen on the next reboot. The PSP will also reset to
default settings.  I would be HUGELY surprised if anyone bricked their PSP with
those hacks, as they write only to the data part of the registry (system.dreg).
